name: us-review
description: Verify that an ingested user story was correctly extracted - restructure it (story, acceptance criteria, business rules, open points) and have the user confirm or fix the extraction. Use right after ingesting a US, and whenever someone asks whether a specification was read faithfully, whether acceptance criteria were missed, or wants to check an extraction before designing tests on top of it. Second step of the QAIA journey, after us-ingest.

# us-review — extraction check

Follow the shared contract in `../README.md`. Prerequisite: `00-source.md` (else offer
`us-ingest`).

## Steps

1. **Structure the capture.** From `00-source.md`, produce a structured extraction:

   - **Story** — As a / I want / So that, quoted or faithfully paraphrased if present. If absent
     but a real capability is described, **reconstruct it and mark it `[reconstructed]`**;
     otherwise write "not expressed in the source".
   - **Numbered acceptance criteria**, quoted or faithfully paraphrased.
   - **Business rules and constraints** found outside the AC list.
   - **Referenced artifacts not analyzed** — attachments, mockups, links.
   - **Anything present in the source but not classifiable** — keep it visible, never drop
     content.

   The `[reconstructed]` marker is what makes a reconstruction legitimate. A story the reader
   believes came from the source, when in fact you wrote it, silently turns your interpretation
   into the requirement everything downstream is tested against. **Mentioning it in prose is not
   enough**: the marker sits on the artifact itself, where the next step reads it.

2. **Show the diff mentality.** Present the structure and explicitly list what you did **not**
   find — no AC numbering, no story, and so on. Do not invent missing parts.

   - **If the extraction has no acceptance criteria and no described behavior at all** (a design
     doc, an RFC, an empty template, a non-spec): say so plainly and route back to the user for
     real requirements rather than emitting an empty shell.
   - **A thin US that names a real capability is NOT a non-spec.** A bare `Feature:` with a title
     and a `Background:` — "Feature: Profile" / "a signed-in user" — *does* describe testable
     behavior. Proceed and generate, marking inferred behavior `[assumption]`.

   The not-a-spec gate fires only on genuine non-requirements, never on a real-but-underspecified
   story.

3. ⚠ VALIDATION: the user confirms the extraction or corrects it — a missing AC, a wrong split, a
   misread rule. Apply corrections and re-show until confirmed.

   **In a non-interactive context with no user available, do NOT mark this step done.** Write the
   extraction with status `unconfirmed`, leave `01-review` as `pending-validation` in
   `journey.md`, record the `simulated` entry in `openArbitrations[]`, **and continue**.

   Marking the step done on the strength of a self-issued "accepted as is" note annuls the only
   control this skill provides: the point of the step is that *a human confirmed the extraction
   matches the source*, and nothing the skill writes about itself can stand in for that.

   Note precisely what the control is and is not. **Stopping the journey is not the control** — a
   run that stops is simply a run nobody finishes, and harnesses restart it anyway. **Refusing to
   mark the step done is.** Follow `../README.md` rule 3 verbatim; it is the single arbitration.

4. **Checkpoint.** Write `.qaia/state/<US-ID>/01-extraction.md` with the confirmed structure.
   Update `journey.md`: step `01-review` = done **only if step 3's validation actually
   happened**, otherwise `pending-validation`. Next step: `need-understanding`.

## Guardrails

- **Faithfulness over polish.** When the source is ambiguous, reproduce the ambiguity and flag
  it — resolving it is the next skill's job, with the user.
- **Every AC gets a stable number here** (`AC1`, `AC2`…). Downstream traceability — the coverage
  matrix, the scenario IDs — anchors on these numbers, so never renumber after validation.
