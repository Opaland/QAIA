"""Fail when a skill published to an external directory drifts from the skill it was derived from.

Why this exists. QASkills.sh and directories like it take a **single self-contained SKILL.md**.
QAIA's skills are deliberately not that: three sprints were spent moving long reasoning into
`references/` so the SKILL.md stays readable. Publishing therefore means shipping a *derived*
artifact, and a derived artifact with nothing watching it is a copy that silently stops matching
its original — the exact dette this project just closed for `OUTPUT-CONTRACT.md` by shipping it
into every plugin **with a CI job keeping the copies identical**.

The copies here cannot be byte-identical: they are adaptations, self-contained on purpose, with
different frontmatter and no `references/`. So identity is the wrong check. What is checkable is
**provenance**: each published copy records the sha256 of every source file it was derived from.
When a source changes, the recorded hash no longer matches and this fails — forcing whoever
changed the skill to look at the copy and decide, rather than letting the two drift apart
unnoticed for months.

Refreshing after a deliberate change is one command:

    python eval/tools/check_published_copies.py --update

which rewrites the recorded hashes. That command is the decision point: running it means "I have
looked at the published copy and it still says the truth", and the diff it produces is reviewable.

Exit codes: 0 all copies current, 1 at least one source changed since its copy was reviewed,
2 the manifest itself is missing or malformed.
